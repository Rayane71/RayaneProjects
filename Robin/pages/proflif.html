        Williams kick-started his career by performing stand-up comedy in the
        San Francisco Bay Area in 1976. He moved to Los Angeles and continued
        performing stand-up at clubs including
        <strong>The Comedy Store</strong>. <br />
        There he was seen by a TV producer who asked him to appear on a revival
        of his show <q>Laugh-In</q>. The show was his debut TV appearance. While
        the <q>Laugh-In</q> revival failed, it led Williams into his television
        career.<br />
        He continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs to help keep his
        improvisational skills sharp.

        With his success on <em>Mork & Mindy</em>, Williams began to reach a
        wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three HBO comedy
        specials: <em>Off The Wall</em> (1978),
        <em>An Evening with Robin Williams</em> (1983), and
        <em>A Night at the Met</em> (1986). <br />
        Williams won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the recording of
        his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York,
        <em>Reality ... What a Concept.</em>

        Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he
        started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said
        that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally
        performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period he was
        using cocaine, he said it made him paranoid when performing on stage.<br />
        William's once said
        <em>
          <q>
            You're only given a little spark of Madness.
            <span>you mustn't lose it!</span>
