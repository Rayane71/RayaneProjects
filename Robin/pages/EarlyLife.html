                    Williams's father, Robert, was an executive for the <a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="_blank" title= "Visit Ford Motor's website">Ford Motor Company</a>, and his mother was a former fashion model. While his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's Episcopal faith. During a television interview on <em>Inside the Actors Studio in 2001</em>, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.In late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. The family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on 20 acres in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he was a student at the private Detroit Country Day School.

            <div class="col-4 scl"><p>Williams attended public Gorton Elementary School and Junior High School. He excelled in school, as he described himself as the <q>quiet child</q> who did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department. His friends recall him as <q>very funny </q>.</p>
                <p>Williams studied political science at Claremont Men's College  where he began taking courses in improvisation.
                He then attended the College of Marin to study acting. According to the college's drama professor <strong>James Dunn</strong>, the depth of the young actor's talent became evident when he was cast in the musical <em> Oliver!</em> as Fagin. Williams often improvised during his time in the drama program, leaving cast members in hysterics.Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her Williams <q>was going to be something special</q>.</p>

                <p>In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School in NYC.
                When he moved back to California, he began appearing in comedy clubs. During the summers of 1974 to 1976, he was working as busboy. He left Juilliard during his junior year at the suggestion of Houseman, who said <mark style = "background-color: rgb(122, 3, 3);color:peachpuff;">there was nothing more Juilliard could teach him</mark>. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, said Williams was a <q>genius</q> and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him.
